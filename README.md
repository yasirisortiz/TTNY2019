# TTNY2019

## Inspiration

According to the Coalition for the Homeless, “As of August 2019, there were 61,674 homeless people, including 14,806 homeless families with 21,802 homeless children sleeping each night in the New York City municipal shelter system.”

We want to help change that

## What it does

ComeHelpUs serves as a bridge between those in need and those that can help; we connect them. This service records nearby food, clothing, school supplies, and book drives and shares that information with others. Organizations can register and have their events listed for the public to see. For those that want to volunteer their time, they can do so by delivering food to a homeless person in their proximity. By doing this, they gain points that add up in their profile statistics. For the homeless and those in need, there is no account creation required as this does not match up with their lifestyle and the resources available, instead, by noting where they are located and what they need, they put that information on our site for a volunteer to go to them. Additionally, as the drives are listed on the site, if there is one close to their proximity, they can attend those.  

## How we built it

Front-end: HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Jinja2, CSS  
Back-end: Flask, MongoDB

## Challenges we ran into

For the backend, the hardest part was getting the DB working in the proper form.  
For the front end, the integration between back and front end components is still difficult.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of this idea and our desire to see it through as well as all the hours we put into learning different concepts that presented themselves as the project developed.

## What we learned

Integration takes time, and for next time we need to allocate for time for it.

## What's next for ComeHelpUs

After the hackathon, we want to continue working on the project and seeing it through.
